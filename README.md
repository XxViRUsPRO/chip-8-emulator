# CHIP-8 Emulator: A Learning Journey

This project started as an exploration of the CHIP-8, a classic 8-bit virtual machine. By emulating its architecture – 4KB memory, 16 registers, and custom opcodes – I gained a deeper understanding of how processors work. Each instruction decoded and executed brought the CHIP-8 to life, showcasing how simple components can create complex functionality.

Building this emulator wasn't just about nostalgia; it was about demystifying emulation. It's about translating instructions and managing resources to recreate another system's behavior. This hands-on experience solidified my programming concepts and ignited a passion for exploring the inner workings of computers.

While this project remains a work in progress, the journey itself has been invaluable. It opened doors to a fascinating world of emulation, where even the seemingly impossible becomes possible through code and understanding.
